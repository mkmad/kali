**NETSTAT** - netstat provides statistics about all active connections so you can find out which computers or networks a PC is connected to.

usage: `netstat -ano`

e.g.
```
projects Â» netstat -ano | grep "tcp"                                                      
tcp4       0      0  192.168.2.11.57961     170.114.52.10.443      ESTABLISHED

**ARP SCAN** - scans the network that the device is connected for devices, the output lists device ip addresses, MAC addresses and Device Description.

usage: `arp-scan -l`

e.g.
```
# arp-scan -l
Interface: wlan1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:c0:ca:96:65:fe, IPv4: 192.168.1.137

```

**NETDISCOVER** - Newer version of arp scan, here we can also specify subnet ranges for the scan.

usage: `netdiscover -r 192.168.1.0/24`

e.g.
```
 Currently scanning: finished   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

 43 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 5 hosts.   Total size: 1806

**NMAP** - Network mapper tool, for a given machine ip, we can use nmap to scan all the open ports and services in that machine.

usage: `nmap -T4 -p- -A <ip_address>`
* T is the speed of the scan, the scan speeds are from 1 (slowest + through) to 5 (fast + not through) 
* p is the port number, `-` means everyting
* A means show all info

e.g.
```
# nmap -T4 -p 80 -A 192.168.1.160
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-01-08 05:30 UTC
